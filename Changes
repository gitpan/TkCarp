Revision history for Perl extension Tk::Carp.

Version 1.2
  Released to CPAN May 11, 2004.

  Added support for different icons for deaths and warnings.

  Added tkDeathsNonFatal option.

  Suppressed handling of die inside of eval and added a Tk::Error
  sub to compensate (Tk wraps all calls to user code in evals and
  handles errors via Tk::Error).  This prevents spurrious errors that
  are caught by eval and never propagated from being sent to dialogs.

Version 1.1
  Released to PerlMonks August 20, 2001.

  Added tkwarn and tkdie.

  Changed $Tk::Carp::UseMessageBox to $Tk::Carp::UseTkDialog and
  inverted the sense.  Added useMessageBox as a special import directive.

  Fixed bug that caused applications to remain running after had closed
  the application's MainWindow.  This bug only occurred if the user
  specified immediateWarnings, set $Tk::Carp::MainWindow and
  a warning was raised before the application entered the MainLoop.  It
  was due to the fact that the dialog created its own MainWindow, the
  reference to which was lost when the user set $Tk::Carp::MainWindow,
  and the fact that Tk's MainWindows are not destroy()'ed when
  no more user variables point to them.

  Fixed bug that caused widgets on the user's MainWindow to not respond to
  any mouse events if a warning was raised (with immediateWarnings)
  between the user setting $Tk::Carp::MainWindow and entering MainLoop
  and which was displayed with messageBox.  I'm still not sure what caused
  it; it appears to be a bug in (probably) messageBox().  I could only fix
  it by creating a new MainWindow every time messageBox() was called,
  and destroy()'ing it immediately afterwards.  This makes useTkDialog
  even more relatively efficient.

Version 1.0
